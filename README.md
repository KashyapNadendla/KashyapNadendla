### Hello 👋

I'm Kashyap, a Software Developer and an aspiring Data Scientist. Hiking is a passion of mine and I try to push myself to reach greater heights and see the biggest Mountains. I'm an avid nature lover who is fascinated by the world around. I also hope to one day become a Sports Analyst!

- 🌱 I’m a graduate student at the University of Arizona studying Data Science
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ML, Data Mining and Data Visualization projects
- 👨‍💻 I worked at LTI Mindtree as a Frontend Developer on a Sustainable Future application
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ML and Data Visualization projects to gain more knowledge in the field
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with R programming
- 💬 Ask me about my travels in the Mountains!
- ⚡ Fun fact: 14,632 feet is the highest I've hiked upto!
