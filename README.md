### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kashyap, a Software Engineer who is jumping into the vortex that is AI! Hiking is a passion of mine and I try to push myself to reach greater heights and see the biggest Mountains. I'm an avid nature lover who is fascinated by the world around. I also hope to one day become a Sports Analyst!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working as an AI Engineer at the University of Arizona. We're a student workforce developing applications integrated with LLMs and Gen AI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my travels in the Mountains!
- âš¡ Fun fact: 14,632 feet is the highest I've hiked upto!
