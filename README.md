### Hello ğŸ‘‹

I'm Kashyap, a Software Engineer and an aspiring Data Scientist. Hiking is a passion of mine and I try to push myself to reach greater heights and see the biggest Mountains. I'm an avid nature lover who is fascinated by the world around. I also hope to one day become a Sports Analyst!

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m also working as an AI Engineer at the University of Arizona.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my travels in the Mountains!
- âš¡ Fun fact: 14,632 feet is the highest I've hiked upto!
